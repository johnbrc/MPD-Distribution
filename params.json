Accordingly, MPD handbooks are formulated to rely simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate small-group study, reflection and discussion, with the goal of facilitating biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.\r\n\r\n##\tGoal and Ethos\r\n\r\nMaize Plant Discipleship is being developed as a (relatively) free cultural resource. *Relatively* because the strict definition of FCRs is, well, strict and MPD may not comply exactly. However, it's the closest and simplest description of the aim.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that it is being distributed with a Creative Commons International Licence intended to make it simple and straightforward for translation and republication (e.g. printing and distribution) to take place in response to the resource's digital publication.\r\n\r\n# Find Out More\r\n\r\n##\tWiki\r\n\r\nThis `MPD-Distribution` repository has a comprehensive [wiki], documenting relevant information about the project and how to utilise the repository for the purposes of translation and republication.\r\n\r\n##\tProspectus\r\n\r\nFor offline distribution: outline, syllabus, author's vita, internet addresses, contact details\r\n\r\n-\t[Prospectus](pdf/Prospectus.pdf) ⬇️ (pdf)\r\n\r\n## \tWebsite\r\n\r\n-\t[Project Website] for Maize Plant Discipleship\r\n\r\n#\tThank You\r\n\r\n…for your interest in and support for this project.\r\n\r\n##\tDr J.B.
