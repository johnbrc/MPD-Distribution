## Versioning

Each draft PDF is stamped / identified with a generated date, time and version number according to the convention: *N.n.nn*, where:

- *N* is a **distributed version** number—upgraded each time an AUTHORised version of document is *distributed* to readers, editors, translators, publishers. 

- *n* is an **author's version** number—upgraded each time a significant revision (i.e. series of textual changes) is made following input from readers, editors, translators, publishers or author.

- *nn* is an **author's iteration** number—upgraded to distinguish a minor, *iterative* revision to an AUTHOR'S VERSION. *It is, to most intents and purposes, a classic example of overkill. Or obsessive-compulsive order (sic).*

The same version numbering system is used on MPD Releases, issued via GitHub.
