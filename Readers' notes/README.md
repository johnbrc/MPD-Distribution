# Dear Reader

Thank you for agreeing to read the prototype module of the *Maize Plant Discipleship Resource*. The module that you are Reading is *Module 4*—of sixteen that make up the Syllabus—focussing upon *The Commissioning of Messianic Community*. 

### I Would Like Your Personal Reflections ###

*This is the most essential aspect of the task*. I am not asking for you to imagine how the text will be received by Burkinabé readers, in the future. I simply ask you to reflect upon your own experience of the text, as you read through it. Whatever occurs to you, please record it and use that record to reflect your experience back to me, by:

- Making notes of your reflections as you read through the resource.
- Typing up your notes and send them to me in an attachment, referencing your comments to the relevant section header and paragraph (first, second etc.)

### I Would Like You to Read One Chapter at a Time ###

The module has been designed to be worked through by a study, discussion or discipleship group, over four weeks, a chapter at a time. Please read through in a way that mirrors this to some extent, allowing a certain amount of time between each chapter. Not a whole week though, because…

### I Would Like Your Feedback Within a Fortnight ###

This will allow me to maintain deadlines set for the project. If you cannot complete your Reading and reflections, please send me whatever you have done by Monday 15th July.

*If you have any questions, at all, please ask them*.

Thank you for your interest in and support for this project.
