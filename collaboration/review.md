# Reviewing Maize Plant Discipleship

Maize Plant Discipleship is 

> "…a practical, relevant and accessible discipleship resource, designed in consultation with Africans, for use in African contexts, being published as a series of low-cost, short, modular textbooks, incorporating oral and literary components and therefore suitable for formal and informal study, so that biblical education that starts inside classrooms does not end there, but moves constantly outwards, drawing whole communities into a pattern of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture."

![][image] The project is based upon the "leaders and learners" training seminars that I have presented during my regular visits to Burkina Faso, West Africa, over the past decade *and* upon my recent doctoral research, with *Fuller School of Intercultural Studies*. Our immediate goal is the production, publication and translation of three text books for a pilot project.

## What's Involved?

Mainly giving an honest opinion, pointing out those things that work well and those things that don't, from your personal perspective. *Note*: I don't want you to respond to how you think the text may be received by any particular constituency: I simply want your personal reflections upon the text, *as you encounter it*. 

You can either:

-	**Annotate the PDF file**—MPD-*.pdf—using annotation tools built into your PDF reader[^for annotating PDFs on iPads, I recommend the *GoodNotes* app] making certain to save annotated files separately to the original.

Or,

-	**Type comments into the plain-text file**—MPD-*.md—ideally using this simple syntax: 

	`{== Your comments, between these markers ==}`

Then, return annotated files, to: **<jbclements@icloud.com>**—*thank you!*
