# 	Guidance Notes for Reviewers

Thank you for agreeing to review upon *Maize Plant Discipleship Resources*.  The following notes provide guidance regarding my expectations of *Reviewers*.

### 	Please Read A Chapter at a Time 

The module has been designed to be worked through by a study, discussion or discipleship group, over four weeks, a chapter at a time. Please read through in a way that mirrors this to some extent, allowing a certain amount of time between each chapter. 

### 	Please Give Your Honest, Personal Reflections 

*This is the most essential aspect of the task*. 

-	I am not asking you to respond to how you think, imagine or believe the text will be received by any particular constituency, now nor in the future. 

-	I simply want you to reflect upon *your own experience of the text*, as you read through it and, whatever occurs to you, record your reflection.

### Recording Your Reflections

If you contact the author, you may be provided access to the document on *Editorially.com*, which has inbuilt reviewing tools. Alternatively,

-	Record your comments directly within the MPD-*.md file, of the module you are reviewing (e.g. MPD-M4.md), as follows: {== Your comments ==}

-	Alternatively, annotate the PDF file, of the module you are reviewing (e.g. MPD-M4.pdf) using annotation tools built into your PDF reader; be sure to save annotated files separately.

### Deadlines 

-	See [MPD-Distribution] for requested deadline for feedback.
