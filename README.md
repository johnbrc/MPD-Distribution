#	Maize Plant Discipleship

Maize Plant Discipleship is a practical, relevant and accessible discipleship resource, developed in consultation with missional leaders and learners in Burkina Faso, to be appropriate for use in African contexts.

Maize Plant Discipleship handbooks are formulated to rely simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate small-group study, reflection and discussion, with the goal of facilitating biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.
