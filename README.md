#	Maize Plant Discipleship

*Maize Plant Discipleship* (hereafter, MPD) is a teaching, training and educational resource, designed in collaboration with Africans, for use in African contexts.

MPD handbooks are formulated to facilitate reflective group learning—so that Maize Plant Discipleship resources rely not upon the presence of a qualified leader, teacher or theologian, but simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate study groups and discussions.
