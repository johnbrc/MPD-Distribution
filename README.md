# Maize Plant Discipleship

*Maize Plant Discipleship* (hereafter, MPD) refers to a discipleship resource designed in collaboration with Africans, for use in African contexts (and other post-colonial contexts). 

The *MPD Syllabus* incorporates the following sixteen *Modules*, each of which will, in due course, have an associated textbook:

1. The Eternal Purpose of God
2. The Dynamic of Vocation, Part A: The Nations
3. The Dynamic of Vocation, Part B: The Jewish People
4. The Dynamic of Commissioning
5. The Dynamic of Body Membership
6. The Dynamic of Revival
7. The Dynamic of Truth
8. The Dynamic of Intercession
9. The Dynamic of Cultural Transformation
10. The Disciplines of Spiritual Maturity
11. The Disciplines of Running the Race Marked Out For Us
12. The Disciplines of Pressing Towards Our Vocation
13. The Disciplines of Financial Faithfulness
14. The Disciplines of Leadership
15. The Disciplines of Living By Faith
16. The Disciplines of Overcoming In The Arena of Spiritual Conflict

MPD textbooks are especially intended to facilitate group discussions, on the back of scripture readings and a series of topical studies, so that the *Syllabus* provided by the resource does not require the input of an *expert* teacher, merely a person, or persons willing to *facilitate* the co-ordination of small study groups and discussions.

## Versioning

Each draft PDF is stamped / identified with a generated date, time and version number according to the convention: *N.n.nn*, where:

- *N* is a **distributed version** number—upgraded each time an AUTHORised version of document is *distributed* to readers, editors, translators, publishers. 

- *n* is an **author's version** number—upgraded each time a significant revision (i.e. series of textual changes) is made following input from readers, editors, translators, publishers or author.

- *nn* is an **author's iteration** number—upgraded to distinguish a minor, *iterative* revision to an AUTHOR'S VERSION. *It is, to most intents and purposes, a classic example of overkill. Or obsessive-compulsive order (sic).*
