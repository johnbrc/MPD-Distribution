#	Maize Plant Discipleship

A modular learning resource, derived and road-tested in collaboration with Africans, formulated in response to contextual doctoral research in Burkina Faso, designed to be practical, relevant and accessible for use in African and other Majority-World contexts

###	Goal 

Maize Plant Discipleship handbooks are formulated to rely simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate small-group study, reflection and discussion, with the goal of facilitating biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.
