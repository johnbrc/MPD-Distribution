# Maize Plant Discipleship

*Maize Plant Discipleship* (hereafter, *MPD*) is a discipleship resource designed in collaboration with Africans, for use in African contexts.

-	The *MPD Syllabus* incorporates 16 *Modules* and a *Handbook*, each of which will, in due course, have an associated textbook. 

-	*MPD Resources* are especially intended to facilitate group discussions, on the back of scripture readings and a series of topical studies, so that the syllabus provided by the resource does not require the input of an *expert* teacher, merely a person, or persons willing to *facilitate* the co-ordination of small study groups and discussions.
