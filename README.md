# Maize Plant Discipleship

*Maize Plant Discipleship* (hereafter, *MPD*) is a discipleship resource designed in collaboration with Africans, for use in African contexts.

-	The *MPD Syllabus* incorporates 16 *Modules* and a *Handbook*, each of which will, in due course, have an associated textbook. 

-	*MPD Resources* are especially intended to facilitate group discussions, on the back of scripture readings and a series of topical studies, so that the syllabus provided by the resource does not require the input of an *expert* teacher, merely a person, or persons willing to *facilitate* the co-ordination of small study groups and discussions.

## Publication ##

The intention is to publish *MPD Resources* along the lines of a *Free Cultural Resources (FCR)*, or those of *Open-Source Software (OSS)*. More details to follow. Meanwhile, your interest and collaboration is invited.

#### Licensing

*MPD Resources* are typically available under the terms of a *Creative Commons license*, which licences reproduction, including translation, providing proper attribution is made. Each textbook, or similar resource, incorporates a CC licence. 

-	See *Licence.md* for further information.

#### Translation

It is particularly hoped that *MPD Resources* will be translated into a number of other languages besides English, starting with French, which is one of the national languages of Burkina Faso. Involvement with the people of Burkina Faso represents one of the principal inspirations responsible for the development of *MPD Resources*.
