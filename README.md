#	Maize Plant DiscipleshipMaize Plant Discipleship:-	a practical, relevant and accessible discipleship resource,-	designed in consultation with missional leaders and learners in Burkina Faso, to be appropriate for use in African contexts,-	reliant simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate small-group study, reflection and discussion,-	with the goal of facilitating biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.Maize Plant Discipleship is presently being prepared for publication:-	as a series of short, modular, low-cost handbooks,-	incorporating reflective learning and group discussions,-	accessible for translation into other languages.Maize Plant Discipleship is formulated in response to doctoral research that:-	gathered and analysed qualitative data relating to the perspectives, insights, beliefs and concerns of Burkinabé leaders and learners;-	explored significant tensions between modern, Western theological education and scripturally-based discipleship praxis;-	resulted in the award of a Doctorate of Missiology, from Fuller School of Intercultural Studies (Pasadena, CA), in 2012.##	About-	[Read more] about Maize Plant Discipleship-	[Download] Maize Plant Discipleship files-	[Explore] the history and educational philosophy shaping the development of Maize Plant Discipleship.## Thank You ##…for your interest in and support for this project.**Dr J.B.
