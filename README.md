#	Maize Plant Discipleship

[Maize Plant Discipleship](http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com) is a modular, biblical learning resource designed to be practical, relevant and accessible for use in African and other Majority World contexts. 

### Formulation

The resource has been formulated according to a set of characteristics [defined](http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com/the-formula/defined-characteristics) in response to doctoral research, combined with practical experience, amongst leaders and learners in Burkina Faso, West Africa.

- The outcome is a modular, low-tech handbook that equips facilitators for small-group study, reflection and discussion, which can be inexpensively printed and distributed—or accessed directly on electronic devices.

### Approach

The goal is to facilitate biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture. 

- To reach towards this goal, the project focuses upon [publication of digital resources](https://github.com/johnbrc/MPD-Distribution/wiki/Digital-publication) that can be easily accessed and economically printed, distributed and translated.
