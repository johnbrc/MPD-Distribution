#	Maize Plant Discipleship

###	Concept

> Maize Plant Discipleship is a learning resource, presently being prepared for publication, which has been derived and road-tested in collaboration with Africans and formulated in response to contextual doctoral research in Burkina Faso, to be practical, relevant and accessible for use in African and other post-colonial contexts.

> Accordingly, MPD handbooks are formulated to rely simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate small-group study, reflection and discussion, with the goal of facilitating biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.

###	Goal and Ethos

Maize Plant Discipleship is being developed as an [Open Educational Resource]. In practice, this means that it is being distributed with a Creative Commons International Licence intended to make it simple and straightforward for translation and republication (e.g. printing and distribution) to take place in response to the resource's *digital* publication.
