#	Maize Plant Discipleship

[Maize Plant Discipleship](http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com) is a biblical learning resource designed to be practical, relevant and accessible for use in African and other Majority World contexts. It has been derived and road-tested in collaboration with Africans and formulated in response to contextual doctoral research conducted in Burkina Faso, for publication as a syllabus of short, modular handbooks, which:

-	equip facilitators to coordinate small learning groups
-	incorporate reflective learning and group discussions
-	are suitable for formal and informal modes of study
-	are inexpensive to print, distribute and translate.

The goal is to facilitate biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture. 

- To reach towards this goal, the project focuses upon [publication of digital resources](https://github.com/johnbrc/MPD-Distribution/wiki/Digital-publication) that can be easily accessed and economically printed, distributed and translated.
