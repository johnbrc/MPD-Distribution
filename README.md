#	Maize Plant DiscipleshipMaize Plant Discipleship is a practical, relevant and accessible discipleship resource, designed in consultation with missional leaders and learners in Burkina Faso, to be appropriate for use in African contexts.Maize Plant Discipleship handbooks are formulated to be reliant simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate small-group study, reflection and discussion, with the goal of facilitating biblical learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.##	About-	[Read more] about Maize Plant Discipleship-	[Download] Maize Plant Discipleship files-	[Explore] the history and educational philosophy shaping the development of Maize Plant Discipleship.## Thank You ##…for your interest in and support for this project.**Dr J.B.
