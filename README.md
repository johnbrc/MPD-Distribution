# Maize Plant Discipleship Resource 

*Maize Plant Discipleship* (hereafter, MPD) refers to the identity of a resource designed, in collaboration with Africans, for use in African contexts.

-	*MPD Resource* comprises sixteen *modules* and a *Facilitators' Handbook*, intended for publication as a series of low-cost textbooks. They are also being made available in a variety of other digital formats, to facilitate widespread accessibility.

-	*MPD Resource* is especially intended to facilitate group discussions, on the back of scripture readings and a series of topical, biblical studies, so that the syllabus provided by the resource does not require the input of an *expert* teacher, merely a person, or persons willing to *facilitate* the co-ordination of small study groups and discussions.

-	See [MPD Resource website](http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com) for further information.
