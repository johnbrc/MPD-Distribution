### 	MultiMarkdown ###

This README is composed in [MultiMarkdown][Md], as are many of the files in this distribution. Markdown is essentially a plain-text language that is both human-readable and computer-readable; it is particularly used to generate [LaTex PDFs][latex] and [HTML][html] files. 

MultiMarkdown files can be edited in any plain-text editor. [MultiMarkdown Composer][Mmdc] provides an ideal (OSX) editing environment.

### 	LaTex (PDF) ###
