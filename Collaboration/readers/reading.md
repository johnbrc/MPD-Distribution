# 	Guidance Notes for Readers

Thank you for agreeing to read and provide feedback upon *Maize Plant Discipleship Resources*.  The following notes provide guidance regarding my expectations of Readers.

### 	I Would Like Your Personal Reflections ###

*This is the most essential aspect of the task*. I am not asking for you to imagine how the text will be received by any particular constituency, now or in the future. I simply ask you to reflect upon your own experience of the text, as you read through it. Whatever occurs to you, please record it and use that record to reflect your experience back to me.

- 	Reference your comments to relevant section header (e.g. S4.3) and paragraph (par. a, b, c etc.)
- 	Forward your comments to author.

### 	Please Read One Chapter at a Time ###

The module has been designed to be worked through by a study, discussion or discipleship group, over four weeks, a chapter at a time. Please read through in a way that mirrors this to some extent, allowing a certain amount of time between each chapter. 
*If you have any questions, at all, please ask them*.

-	If you are responding to a particular timed *Release*, please see [VERSION][] for requested deadline for feedback.
