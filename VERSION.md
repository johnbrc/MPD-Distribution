## Version control

Each draft PDF is stamped / identified with a generated date, time and version number according to the convention: *N.n.nn*, where:

- N is a *distributed version* number—upgraded each time an *author*ised version of document is *distributed* to readers, editors, translators, publishers. 

- n is an *author's version* number—upgraded each time a significant revision is made following input from readers, editors, translators, publishers or the author.

- nn is an *author's iteration* number—upgraded to distinguish a minor, *iterative* revision to an *author's version*. It is, to most intents and purposes, a classic example of overkill. Or obsessive-compulsive order (sic), which may be safely be ignored, or overlooked by most collaborators.

N.b. the same version numbering system is used on GitHub releases and pre-releases.
