# Current Version #

The current version of MPD Resource [files](content/content.md) can be identified:
-	From metadata at the top of editable source files written in MultiMarkdown.
-	From a date-time stamp and version number located on the first and, or second page of PDFs.

## Version control

Version numbers follow the convention: **N.n.nn**, where:

-	**N = distributed version number**

	Upgraded each time an *author*-ised version of document is *distributed* to readers, editors, translators, publishers. 

-	**n = author's version number**

	Upgraded each time a *significant revision* is made following input from readers, editors, translators, publishers or the author.

-	**nn = author's iteration number**

	Upgraded each time an *iterative revision* is made to an *author's version*. 

	nn is thus, to most intents and purposes, a classic example of overkill. Or obsessive-compulsive order (sic), which may be safely be ignored, or overlooked by most collaborators.

N.b. the same version numbering system is used on GitHub releases and pre-releases.
