#	Modules

Maize Plant Discipleship (MPD) is a learning resource, consisting of 16 modules, published in digital format to facilitate [translation] and [republication] as a series of low-cost handbooks. 

Accordingly, files in the [MPD-Distribution] repository are distributable for the purposes of facilitating translation and republication, under the terms of a Creative Commons Licence[^CCL].

### Files

A list of typically [available files](../Files.md), per module

###	Derivation and format

MPD is authored in [Scrivener], from whence it is compiled (exported) respectively, in the following formats:

-	`*.md` — MultiMarkdown[^mmd], see [Translation]
-	`*.tex` — PDF LaTex[^latex], used to generate high-quality PDF files
-	`*.pdf` — Portable Document Format, for distribution and republication (printing).

Note: MultiMarkdown and LaTex files are distributed with associated image files.

Files in the following formats may be included in distributions, as a boon (*i.e. undocumented; unsupported*):

-	`*.html` — Hyper-Text Markup Language , for offline reading, using standard internet web browsers
-	`*.ePub` etc.

##	Translation

MultiMarkdown files are useful for translation, since they provide a highly structured document which can be easily followed by translators. 

Furthermore, if a translation adopts precisely the same structure, it facilitates the production of high-quality PDF-LaTex and HTML that closely echoes the source text in the original language.

##	Republication

PDF files provide a high-quality digital file, formatted ready-to-print. 

###	Print format

MPD handbooks are designed to be printed economically as A5-format books, stitched (stapled), rather than bound, with a lightweight cover.

-	I.e. 2-up A5 pages, printed double-sided on A4 paper.
-	A maximum no of 56 internal pages, equating to 14 sheets of (double-sided) A4.
