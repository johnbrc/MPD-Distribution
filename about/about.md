# About Maize Plant DiscipleshipMaize Plant Discipleship has been designed in consultation with missional leaders and learners in Burkina Faso, to be a practical, relevant and accessible learning resource, appropriate for use in African contexts.It is being published as a series of low-cost, short, modular textbooks that incorporate reflective learning and group discussions, suitable for formal and informal modes of study.It's goal is to facilitate biblical learning that moves constantly outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.## Further Information -	[Metaphor](metaphor.md)-	[Guidelines](guidelines.md)-	[Syllabus](syllabus.md)-	[Versioning](versioning.md)-	[Publication](publication.md)-	[Translation](translation.md)-	[Imprint](imprint.md)-	[Copyright](copyright.md)-	[Republication](republication.md)-	[License](license.md)-	[Author](author.md)-	[Website]Return to [README](../README.md)[Website]: http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com
