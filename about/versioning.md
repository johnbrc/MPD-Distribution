#	MPD Versioning

Each MPD handbook is identified with a date, time and a version number. Version numbers follow the convention: `N.n.x`, where:

`N` = PUBLISHED edition number

		thus: 	1.0 	First Edition
		and 	0.1.x 	first draft

`n` = DISTRIBUTED version number

revised upwards when an AUTHORised version is DISTRIBUTED for purpose of:

		-	review	 		0.2.x 
		-	copy-editing 	0.3.x,
		-	publication 	0.4.x 
		-	translation 	0.5.x

`x` = AUTHOR's iteration

revised upwards following iterative changes, including input from reviews, proof-reading, copyediting, translation etc.
