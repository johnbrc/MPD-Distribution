Version: For distribution#	Maize Plant Discipleship Syllabus> I tell you that unless a grain of wheat that falls to the ground dies, it stays just a grain; but if it dies, it produces a big harvest — *Jesus, John 12:24*Jesus refers to his own mission using a simple metaphor of seed entering the ground and dying, in order to produce a large harvest. Grown throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the maize plant provides a similar, highly recognisable metaphor. ###	Metaphor of the Maize Plant![] [mp-metaphor]Good seed sown in good soil, stimulated by sunshine and refreshed by rainfall produces dynamic growth and a good harvest.Messianic communities also need to be rooted in good ground that allows us to draw on vital, spiritual *nutrients*, to be stimulated by the revelatory *light* and to be refreshed by the living *water* of the Messiah's Spirit. This creates the *dynamic growth* of messianic community, anchoring it against the withering winds of false teaching and sustaining it amidst the excessive heat of trials, temptations and vocational responsibility. *The figure opposite portrays these basic components of the maize plant metaphor.*##	Syllabus StructureThe Syllabus incorporates a Facilitators' Handbook and 16 Handbooks (one per module) structured to symbolically reflect this metaphor and the imagery of maize, in terms of: soil, roots, plant growth, sunlight and rainfall.-	**[Soil and Roots (Messianic Foundations)]** — which represent the biblical, covenantal community, context and vocation of Israel (Module 1)-	**[Maize Plant (Messianic Dynamics of Growth)]** — which represents the dynamic spiritual growth and multiplication of messianic community (Modules 2 to 9)-	**[Sunlight and Rainfall (Messianic Disciplines of Growth)]** — which represent the essential spiritual disciplines that stimulate and sustain the growth of messianic community (Modules 10 to 16).### Soil and Roots (Messianic Foundations)![][mp-roots]**Module 1**. A panoramic overview of scripture, revealing God's unchanging, eternal purpose—the foundation of the entire syllabus.-	**God's Eternal Purpose** — the Messiah is the *Seed* that enters the *soil* of the biblical, covenantal history of the people of Israel, in order to die and ultimately produce a great harvest of people—a messianic covenant community—from amongst the peoples of the earth. ###	Maize Plant (Messianic Dynamics of Growth)![] [mp-dynamics]**Modules 2 to 9**.
