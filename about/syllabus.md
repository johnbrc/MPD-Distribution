Version: For distribution; needs to be incorporated in MPD-HB #	Maize Plant Discipleship Syllabus> I tell you that unless a grain of wheat that falls to the ground dies, it stays just a grain; but if it dies, it produces a big harvest — *Jesus, John 12:24*Jesus, the Messiah of Israel, refers to his own mission using the simple metaphor of a seed entering the ground and dying, in order to produce a large harvest. Grown throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the maize plant provides a similar, highly recognisable metaphor. ###	Metaphor of the Maize Plant![Figure 1] [mp-metaphor]Good seed sown in good soil, stimulated by sunshine and refreshed by rainfall produces dynamic growth and a good harvest.Messianic communities also need to be rooted in good ground that allows them to draw on vital, spiritual *nutrients*, to be stimulated by the revelatory *light* and to be refreshed by the living *water* of the Messiah's Spirit. This creates the *dynamic growth* of messianic community, anchoring it against the withering winds of false teaching and sustaining it amidst the excessive heat of trials, temptations and vocational responsibility. *Figure 1 portrays these basic components of the maize plant metaphor.*##	Syllabus StructureThe Maize Plant Discipleship Syllabus incorporates a Facilitators' Handbook and 16 modular Handbooks, themed to symbolically reflect the maize plant metaphor by referring to the imagery of soil, roots, growth, sunlight and rainfall.-	**[Soil and Roots]** representing the biblical, covenantal community, context and vocation of Israel (Module 1)-	**[Maize Plant]** representing messianic community and its dynamic spiritual growth and multiplication (Modules 2 to 9)-	**[Sunlight and Rainfall]** representing essential spiritual disciplines, which stimulate and sustain the growth of messianic community (Modules 10 to 16).### Soil and Roots![][mp-roots]**Module 1**.
