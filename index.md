#	Maize Plant Discipleship

[Maize Plant Discipleship](http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com) is a modular, scripturally-based learning resource. Derived and road-tested in collaboration with African leaders and learners and formulated in response to doctoral research conducted in Burkina Faso, Maize Plant Discipleship is designed to be practical, relevant and accessible for use in African contexts:

- Resource Handbook
- 15 modular syllabus handbooks
- providing 60 scripturally-based studies
- 240 topics and 800+ questions
- using accessible language and concepts
- tailored to small learning groups
- incorporating reflective discussions
- suitable for formal and informal study.

The goal of Maize Plant Discipleship is to facilitate learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.
