# Maize Plant Discipleship

Maize Plant Discipleship (hereafter, MPD) is

![][leo]

> "…a practical, relevant and accessible discipleship resource, designed in consultation with Africans, for use in African contexts, published as a series of low-cost, short, modular textbooks, incorporating oral and literary components and suitable for formal and informal study, so that biblical education that starts inside classrooms does not end there, but moves constantly outwards, drawing whole communities into a pattern of scripturally-based discipleship and a living dialogue with contextual culture."

MPD resources are especially intended to facilitate group discussions, related to scripture readings and topical studies, so that the learning process is not dependent upon the presence of an expert teacher, but only of people willing to facilitate the co-ordination of small study groups and discussions.

The [MPD Resource website](http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com) provides further background information, including the research and education philosophy guiding the development of MPD resources.
