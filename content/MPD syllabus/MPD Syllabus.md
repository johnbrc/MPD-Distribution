# Maize Plant Discipleship

Maize Plant Discipleship (hereafter, MPD) refers to the identity of a teaching, training and educational resource, designed in collaboration with Africans, for use in African contexts.

MPD resources are especially intended to facilitate group discussions, related to scripture readings and topical studies, so that the learning process is not dependent upon the presence of an expert teacher, but only of people willing to facilitate the co-ordination of small study groups and discussions.

See [MPD Resource website](http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com), for further background information, including the research and education philosophy guiding the development of MPD resources.

# MPD Syllabus #

> I tell you that unless a grain of wheat that falls to the ground dies, it stays just a grain; but if it dies, it produces a big harvest — *Jesus, John 12:24*

> May he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness — *Paul, 2 Corinthians 9:10*

# Maize Plant Metaphor

In the gospel of John, Jesus refers to his own mission using the metaphor of a seed that enters the ground and dies, in order to produce a large harvest. Grown throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the maize plant provides a similar, highly recognisable metaphor. 

---

> Maize represents the *daily bread* of millions of African people. The messianic community is called, like the Messiah, to become a kind of *life-giving bread* to the peoples of the world—see John 6 & 20:21.

---

The Maize Plant Discipleship Syllabus is structured to symbolically reflect the metaphor of a maize plant. There are three main components to the metaphor.

1.	**[Soil and roots]**

	Representing the biblical, covenantal community, context and vocation of Israel.

-	**[Maize plant]**

	Representing the dynamic spiritual growth and multiplication of messianic community.

-	**[Sunlight and rainfall]**

	Representing essential spiritual disciplines that stimulate and sustain the growth of messianic community.

## Soil and Roots

**Module MPD-M1**[^fn17]—provides a study of the biblical, Hebraic soil and messianic roots of new-covenant faith, gradually unfolding a panoramic overview of the whole story of scripture, representing God's unchanging, eternal purpose.

Only seed sown into good soil produces a good harvest. Discipleship communities also need to be rooted in good soil, allowing us to draw on essential, spiritual nutrients and the living water of the Messiah's Spirit, anchoring us against winds of false teaching and sustaining us amidst the heat of trials, temptations and vocational responsibility.

### MPD-M1-Eternal Purpose

In this foundational teaching, the Messiah represent *the Seed* that enters the soil—of the biblical, covenantal history of the people of Israel—to die and ultimately produce a rich harvest of people—a messianic covenant community—from amongst all the peoples of the earth.

## Maize Plant

**Modules MPD-M2 to MPD-M9** explore eight characteristic *dynamics* of messianic community. These dynamics refer to the unique, spiritual forces[^fn18] that stimulate the characteristic development, growth, structure, shape and fruit of messianic community.
 
![][mp-dynamics]

### MPD-M2-Dynamics of Vocation-The Nations

Examines the historical development the Messianic Community's vocational mission to bless the nations of the world.

### MPD-M3-Dynamics of Vocation-The Jews

Examines the significant responsibilities of the Messianic Community towards the Jewish people.

### MPD-M4-Dynamics of Commissioning 

Explores the dynamic of messianic commissioning, including a focus upon strategy, structures and expansion.

### MPD-M5-Dynamics of Body Membership 

Explores basic patterns of membership, commitment and spiritual maturity within the body of the Messiah.

### MPD-M6-Dynamics of Revival 

Reveals a cycle of spiritual activities representing the dynamics of revival, leading to a spiritual harvest.

### MPD-M7-Dynamics of Truth 

Explores our encounter with truth, as we learn to walk in practical, covenantal faithfulness towards God's revelation, wisdom and direction.

### MPD-M8-Dynamics of Intercession 

Explores the priestly vocation of the Messianic Community to be *a house of prayer for all nations*.

### MPD-M9-Dynamics of Cultural Transformation

Examines our call to work amongst and on behalf of the nations, towards cultural transformations that signal the presence of God's kingdom.

## Sunlight and Rainfall

**Modules MPD-M10 to MPD-M16** examine seven characteristic *disciplines* of messianic community. In the metaphor of the maize plant, sunlight and rainfall are representative of messianic disciplines, which open us to receive the revelatory Light and sustaining Living Water of God's Spirit—without which we become spiritually weak and unable to produce good fruit or a plentiful harvest.

![][mp-disciplines]

### MPD-M10-Disciplines of Spiritual Maturity

### MPD-M12-Disciplines of Pressing Toward Our Vocation

### MPD-M14-Disciplines of Messianic Leadership

Examines the qualifications, motivations and characteristics of faithful messianic leadership *and* proposes a leadership model balancing the needs of tasks, teams and individuals.

### MPD-M15-Disciplines of Living by Faith

### MPD-M16-Disciplines of Overcoming

Employs the analogy of a sporting arena to represent spiritual confrontation and conflict with cultural idols and strongholds, discerning strategies that make room for a transformative encounter with God's overcoming power.

## Format

Each MPD module *Handbook* contains four interrelated *Studies*, each of which incorporates:

-	A Précis
-	Scripture Readings
-	Topical Sections and Summary
-	Questions for Group Discussion

The format is designed to facilitate reflective group learning—so that Maize Plant Discipleship resources rely not upon the presence of a qualified leader, teacher or theologian, but upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate study groups and discussions.
