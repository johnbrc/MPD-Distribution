# MPD Modules #

These files represent *Maize Plant Discipleship Resource* modules.

## File Format ##

Each module is typically released in the following file formats.

### Editable ###

-	.md 

	>MultiMarkdown source files, used to generate *Read Only* files (below)

	>This README is composed in [MultiMarkdown][Md], as are many of the files in this distribution. Markdown is essentially a plain-text language that is both human-readable and computer-readable; it is particularly used to generate [LaTex PDFs][latex] and [HTML][html] files. 

	>MultiMarkdown files may be edited in any plain-text editor, such as *Notepad* (Windows) or *TextEdit* (OSX) ; I use and recommend [MultiMarkdown Composer][Mmdc] as an ideal (OSX) editing environment, not least because of its excellent integration with [Critic Markup][cm].

### Read Only ###

-	.pdf

	>Portable Document Format. Typically provided in A5 (textbook) format and A4 (full page) format; for review and printing; MPD Resource PDFs are generated using [LaTex][latex], a typesetting language that formats and outputs high quality PDFs.

-	.html

	>HTML files, with accompanying images; for browsing in a web browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, or Opera; these files can be viewed *offline*, , on any device, without being connected to the Internet, so are highly distributable.

-	.ePub 

	>ePub files are readable by a wide range of e-readers, however these files are included as a *bonus*, because they are not currently developed to a high degree of utility, nor have they been widely tested.

## File Name Convention ##

-	MPD-Mn
	>Principal files, e.g. MPD-M4.html

-	MPD-Mn-A5, or MPD-Mn-A4
	> PDF filenames also incorporate page-size, e.g. MPD-M4-A5.pdf
