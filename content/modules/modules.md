# MPD Modules #

These files represent *Maize Plant Discipleship Resource* modules.

## File Format ##

Each module is typically released in the following file formats.

### Editable ###

-	.md — MultiMarkdown source files, used to generate [Read Only][] files (below)

	>MultiMarkdown files may be edited in any plain-text editor, such as *Notepad* (Windows) or *TextEdit* (OSX) ; I use and recommend [MultiMarkdown Composer][Mmdc] (OSX), which integrates closely with [Critic Markup][cm].

### Read Only ###

-	.pdf — Portable Document Format
	>Typically provided in A5 (textbook) format and A4 (full page) format; for review and printing
-	.html — HTML files
>With accompanying images; for browsing in a web browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, or Opera; these files can be viewed *offline*, , on any device, without being connected to the Internet, so are highly distributable.
-	.ePub — for use with E-readers
>ePub files are readable by a wide range of e-readers, however these files are included as a *bonus*, because they are not currently developed to a high degree of utility, nor have they been widely tested.

## File Name Convention ##

-	MPD-Mn
>Principal files, e.g. MPD-M4.html
-	MPD-Mn-A5, or MPD-Mn-A4
> PDF filenames also incorporate page-size, e.g. MPD-M4-A5.pdf
