*MPD Resource* is designed for publication as a series of low-cost textbooks. It is also being made available in a variety of other digital formats, to facilitate widespread accessibility. The principal resource incorporates the following:

-	Facilitators' [Handbook](handbook/handbook.md)
- 	Syllabus  [Modules](modules/syllabus.md)

 Module files are located in a folder, MPD-M*n*, where *n* is the module number (e.g. MPD-M4).

## Filenames ##

Principal filenames have (up to) three parts, separated by hyphens, followed by a [Filetype] abbreviation

-	MPD — Maize Plant Discipleship principal resource file (c.f. image file)
-	Mn — Module number *n*
-	As — formatted page size (pdf only)

Thus, for example:

-	A5-sized PDF textbook of module 4 is named: MPD-M4-A5.pdf

## Filetype ##

Each module is made available as a range of [Read-Only Files] files and a single [Editable Source File].

### Read-Only Files ###

Read-only files are provided for review and printing.

-	**PDF — Portable Document Format** (*.pdf)

	Typically provided in A5 (textbook) format and A4 (full page) format; MPD Resource PDFs are generated using [LaTex][latex], a typesetting language that formats and outputs high quality PDFs.

-	**HTML — Hyper-Text Markup Language** (*.html) 

	HTML files, with accompanying images; for browsing in a web browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, or Opera; these files can be viewed *offline*, , on any device, without being connected to the Internet, so are highly distributable.

-	**EPUB — E-Publisher** (*.ePub)

	Readable by a wide range of e-readers, these files are included as a *bonus*, because they are not currently developed to a high degree of utility, nor have they been widely tested.


### Editable Source File ###

Source files are mainly of interest to translators and contributors. They are written in *MultiMarkdown* and are used to generate a range of [Read-Only Files]. 

-	**MultiMarkdown** (*.md) 

	This README is composed in [MultiMarkdown][Md], as are many of the files in this distribution. Markdown is essentially a plain-text language that is both human-readable and computer-readable; it is particularly used to generate [LaTex PDFs][latex] and [HTML][html] files. 

	MultiMarkdown files may be edited in any plain-text editor, such as *Notepad* (Windows) or *TextEdit* (OSX); I use and recommend [MultiMarkdown Composer][Mmdc] as an ideal (OSX) editing environment, not least because of its excellent integration with [Critic Markup][cm].
