# Content 

*MPD Resource* is designed for publication as a series of low-cost handbooks. The intention is to also make content available in a variety of digital formats that facilitate widespread accessibility. The resource incorporates the following:

-	[Facilitators' Handbook](MPD-HB/MPD-HB.md)
- 	Sixteen [Module Handbooks](syllabus.md)

Each module is made available as a range of [Read-Only Files] files and a single [Editable Source File], named as per this convention:

-	MPD 	— Maize Plant Discipleship resource file
-	Mn 	— Module number *n*

Thus, for example, MPD-M4 refers to Module 4.  

## Read-Only Files 

Distributable read-only files are provided for review and printing.

-	**PDF — Portable Document Format** (*.pdf)

	Generally A5 (handbook) format, MPD Resource PDFs are initially generated using [LaTex][latex], a typesetting language that formats and outputs high quality PDFs directly from Multimarkdown. Final publication PDFs will be generated via InDesign.

-	**HTML — Hyper-Text Markup Language** (*.html) 

	HTML files, with accompanying images; for browsing in a web browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, or Opera; these files can be viewed *offline*, , on any device, without being connected to the Internet, so are highly distributable.

-	**EPUB — E-Publisher** (*.ePub)

	Readable by a wide range of e-readers, these files are included as a *boon*, as the current format output is largely unreviewed.


## Editable Source File

Source files are mainly of interest to translators and contributors. They are written in *MultiMarkdown* and are used to generate a range of [Read-Only Files]. 

-	**MMD — MultiMarkdown** (*.md) 

	MultiMarkdown files may be edited in any plain-text editor, such as *Notepad* (Windows) or *TextEdit* (OSX); I use and recommend [MultiMarkdown Composer][Mmdc] as an ideal (OSX) editing environment, particularly with its integration with [Critic Markup][cm].

	This README is composed in [MultiMarkdown][Md], as are many of the files in this distribution. MultiMarkdown is essentially a plain-text language that is both human-readable and computer-readable; it is particularly used to generate [LaTex PDFs][latex] and [HTML][html] files. 

	I am presently experimenting with [Editorially] online publishing workflow, which incorporates Markdown editing, along with collaborative editing and review tools.
