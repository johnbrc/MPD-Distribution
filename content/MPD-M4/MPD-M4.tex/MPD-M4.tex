This module, number 4, explores \emph{God's commissioning} of the Messianic Community, in four inter-related studies:

\begin{studies}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textbf{Commissioning} of Messianic Community

\item The \textbf{Strategies} of Messianic Community

\item The \textbf{Structures} of Messianic Community

\item The \textbf{Expansion} of Messianic Community

\end{enumerate}

\end{studies}

Maize Plant Discipleship handbooks facilitate reflective learning and group discussions, based on scripture readings and topical studies. They rely simply upon facilitators willing to co-ordinate small groups of learners.

Comprehensive guidelines on appropriately facilitating study groups and discussions are incorporated in the \emph{Maize Plant Discipleship Facilitators Handbook}—available from the same source as this handbook, or via the website.

\section{Military commissioning}
\label{militarycommissioning}

This topic examines the experiences of a military solider, in order to enlarge our understanding of what it means to be \emph{commissioned}. It highlights three principal stages of becoming a soldier: calling, training and commissioning.

\subsection{Calling}
\label{calling}

\textbf{A soldier's life starts} when they perceive a \emph{calling} to a life of military service. A calling is an awareness that a particular occupation represents a desirable, compelling, or appropriate vocation to pursue. There may be many reasons why someone enlists in an army, but at some point they sense a calling towards it. 

\subsection{Training}
\label{training}

\textbf{A soldier's calling is tested} with a period of intensive, \emph{basic training}, which potentially equips them for a lifestyle of military service. 

Trainee soldiers experience all kinds of difficult trials and hardships that test their discipline, teamwork, communication, competence, obedience, initiative, determination, loyalty and resolve. During this time, each individual's capabilities and characteristics are either affirmed, enhanced or exposed as inadequate.

At the end of this period, training officers assess whether each soldier has satisfactorily completed basic training. If so, they may begin active service. If not, they must either repeat basic training, until they pass satisfactorily, or leave military service altogether.

\subsection{Commissioning}
\label{military}

\textbf{A soldier's commissioning} represents the beginning of their \emph{active service}, as a member of a regiment, or division of the army. 

They are equipped and authorised for military service: capable, ready and trusted to fulfil their duties—which include general soldiering, as well as a personal vocation such as infantry, chef, driver, engineer, medic, officer and so on.

In this new phase, soldiers continue to lead highly-disciplined lives and to experience difficult trials and tests. However, unlike the training phase, significant achievements are rewarded—generally by receiving enhanced or additional responsibility.

\end{discuss}

\section{God's commissioning}
\label{godscommissioning}

This topic explores the origins of the word \emph{mission} and its connection with \emph{commissioning}, in order to understand how the messianic, new covenant community is united with God's mission.

\subsection{The sending of God}
\label{thesendingofgod}

The English word, \emph{mission}, derives from a Latin word, \emph{missio}, meaning \emph{sending}. It was originally used exclusively to refer to \emph{God's sending of himself},\footnote{\emph{Missio Dei}---an increasingly widespread theological concept; closely equivalent with \emph{God's eternal purpose} (Module 1).} into the world, to restore it from the effects of human wickedness, idolatry, chaos, spiritual darkness, oppression, injustice and evil. We see this in three particular ways. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Old Testament\footnote{Testament = covenant; the \emph{Old Testament} documents the history of the covenant community descended from Abraham; the \emph{New Testament} documents the early experiences of the messianic new-covenant community.} reveals God's covenant presence}

In particular, the \emph{Sh'kinah}, (Hebrew: glorious Presence of God; see Luke 2:9, Hebrews 1:3; 1 John 1:14, 2 Peter 1:17; Matthew 17:6 etc), which manifested as a pillar of cloud and fire during the exodus from Egypt (Exodus 13:17--14:29) and within the \emph{Ark of the Covenant}, visited by Moses and Aaron (Exodus 40) and following Solomon's dedication of the temple (2 Chronicles 7).

\item \textbf{The New Testament reveals the Messiah, Jesus}

As ``Lamb of God,'' apostle and high priest and ``the sole expression of the glory (\emph{Sh'kinah}) of God—the perfect imprint and very image of God's nature''\footnote{Hebrews 4:14--16 and 1:1--4}—in every way Jesus the Messiah reflects the reality that God the Father is a missional god.

\item \textbf{The New Testament reveals the Holy Spirit}

As the \emph{Breath\footnote{Hebrew: \emph{ruach}, can means breath, or spirit}} of the Messiah—sent by the Messiah, as the Messiah was sent by the Father—the Holy Spirit empowers and \emph{sends} the messianic community, anointing us to do the works of God.\footnote{See John 6.28, 14:12--17 and 16:7--11}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The sending of God's people}
\label{thesendingofgodspeople}

Mission, having begun with God's \emph{sending} of himself, is enlarged through the biblical covenants, as the people of God are united with God and his mission—his sending of himself—within the world.

\begin{itemize}
\item This is what commissioning means: \emph{to join, or unite with a particular mission} (\emph{co} means joining, uniting or sharing, thus, \emph{co-mission}).

\item The messianic covenant community is \emph{commissioned} by God: united with his mission to reconcile and restore creation to himself, through the Messiah.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Joining the Messiah's mission}
\label{joiningthemessiahsmission}

The \emph{mission} of Jesus is the purpose for which he was sent into the world: to represent the Father and to do the works of God, forming and sending disciples, in his name.\footnote{John 16:5, for example}

\begin{quote}

As the Father sent me, so I now send you—\emph{John 20:21}
\end{quote}

The \emph{commission} of the messianic community means being united with and sharing in the \emph{mission} of the Messiah: representing the Father, joining him in doing the works of God, forming and sending disciples in his name. 

Thus, \emph{Messianic commission} refers to joining, uniting with the Messiah, in his mission. We are called to be with him; to be prepared, set apart, blessed, anointed and sent towards the world, for the sake of the world; to bless the peoples of the world, in God's name.\footnote{See \emph{Module 1, The Eternal Purpose of God}.}

\end{discuss}

\section{Commissioned as disciples}
\label{commissionedasdisciples}

This topic explores parallels between soldiering and discipleship. 

\subsection{The metaphor of a soldier}
\label{themetaphorofasoldier}

The apostle, Paul, uses the metaphor of a soldier to emphasise that disciples of Jesus Christ must endure discipline, hardship and suffering.\footnote{Modules 10--16 explore the disciplines, hardships and suffering required, as disciples of the Messiah progress in their calling to serve God's eternal purpose.}

\begin{quote}

Take your share of the hardships and suffering which you are called to endure as a good, first-class soldier of Jesus Christ. No soldier when in service gets entangled in the enterprises of civilian life; his aim is to satisfy and please the one who enlisted him—\emph{2 Timothy 2:3--4}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Called to serve}
\label{calledtoserve}

\emph{Military commissioning} (\autoref{militarycommissioning}) explored how soldiering begins with discerning a calling to military service. Messianic discipleship similarly begins with a \emph{calling}. This happens as we personally or corporately discern a calling to serve God's mission, in some way—to serve God's eternal purpose.\footnote{See modules 1--3, incorporating \emph{The Eternal Purpose of God} and \emph{Dynamics of Vocation}.}

\subsection{Many are called, but few are chosen}
\label{manyarecalledbutfewarechosen}

Those who hear and respond to a calling to military service are only commissioned after satisfactorily completing basic training. Jesus' words, \emph{Many are called, but few are chosen}\footnote{Matthew 22:1--14} confirms that hearing the call to serve God's mission is only a start. 

Like soldiers, disciples of the Messiah need to learn the basic disciplines and specialised skills required for vocational service. Like soldiers, progressing from \emph{calling} to \emph{commissioning}—which is what it means to be \emph{chosen} by the Messiah—requires yielding ourselves fully to the demands of vocational service: becoming disciplined, skilled and faithful in response to our calling.

\begin{itemize}
\item The process of calling, training and commissioning is how we are prepared for useful service.\footnote{2 Timothy 2:20--21} 

\item It is how we are enabled to become co-workers with the Messiah in his mission. 

\item It is how we become appointed and anointed to work alongside him, gathering a \emph{harvest of faithfulness,\footnote{Hebrews 12:11}} in the power of his Spirit.

\end{itemize}

\osection{Summary}

This concludes Study 1, \emph{The Commissioning of Messianic Community}, which:

\begin{itemize}
\item explored the metaphor of soldiering, including calling, training and commissioning;

\item explained that \emph{commissioning} essentially means joining together in mission, illustrating how the new-covenant community joins with the Messiah's mission;

\item compared military service with messianic discipleship, highlighting similarities relating to obedience, faithfulness and reward.

\end{itemize}

In summary, the study revealed that

\begin{summary}

\textbf{The Messianic Covenant Community has been commissioned to work alongside the Messiah in his mission: as a community of disciples, called, equipped and chosen to serve God's eternal purpose}

\item Hebrews 5:11--14

\end{itemize}

\section{The strategy of prayer}
\label{thestrategyofprayer}

The foundational strategy of messianic mission is prayer.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=72pt,height=30pt]{pray.png}
\caption{Foundational strategy: prayer}
\label{pray.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Strategic prayer}
\label{strategicprayer}

There are many kinds of prayer, much of which is not \emph{strategic}. Strategic prayer is prayer that is a forward-thinking, planned priority, focussed upon a clear purpose.

\subsection{A plentiful harvest}
\label{aplentifulharvest}

When Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God throughout Israel, he compared a ripe, abundant crop harvest to crowds of distressed and dejected people ``like sheep without a shepherd.'' Then he explained to them: ``The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the labourers are few. So pray to the Lord of the harvest to force and thrust out labourers into his harvest'' (Matthew 9:35--38).

\subsection{A harvesting problem}
\label{aharvestingproblem}

In this way, Jesus explains that the problem is not with the harvest, which is ready to be gathered. The problem is a shortage of labourers ready and willing to gather the harvest—a shortage of trained disciples, ready to be commissioned into service.

How does Jesus teach his disciples to respond to this challenge? He points them directly towards the foundational strategy of mission:

\begin{quote}

\textbf{\emph{Pray to the Lord of the harvest}}.
\end{quote}

\begin{discuss}[\currentsectiontitle]

Use Discussion 1 now, or continue to [][The strategy of reaching] and use Discussions 1--4 together at the end of this Study

\end{discuss}

\section{The strategy of reconciliation}
\label{thestrategyofreconciliation}

The second strategic step of messianic mission is reaching people, in order to encourage reconciliation with God, through the Messiah.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=135pt,height=30pt]{pray-reach.png}
\caption{Second strategy: reconciliation}
\label{pray-reach.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Reconciliation with God}
\label{reconciliationwithgod}

Reaching people implies a holistic process of reconciliation with God and his eternal purpose (Acts 26:17--18). This process of reconciliation incorporates: 

\begin{itemize}
\item God's forgiveness and cleansing of our wrongdoings;

\item Forgiving others for wrongdoings inflicted upon us;

\item Deliverance from dominant sinful behaviour;

\item Cleansing from impurity, both spiritually and practically;

\item Deep renunciation of idols and idolatry;

\item Establishing a wholehearted devotion to the Messiah and his rule in our lives.

\end{itemize}

Unless people experience the transformative power of being reconciled to God, through the Messiah, they cannot be liberated to serve him as disciples. 

\subsection{Being reconciled}
\label{beingreconciled}

Reaching \emph{others} with a message of reconciliation challenges our own lifestyle and faithfulness. If we fail to exhibit kingdom values and priorities, while proclaiming God's kingdom to others, it corrupts our personal testimony and that of the Messianic Community. Before reconciling others, we must ourselves be fully reconciled and submitted to God. 

\begin{discuss}[\currentsectiontitle]

Use Discussion 2 now, or continue to [][The strategy of discipling] and use Discussions 1--6 together at the end of this Study

\end{discuss}

\section{The strategy of discipleship}
\label{thestrategyofdiscipleship}

The third strategy is the formation of disciples.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=198pt,height=30pt]{pray-reach-disciple.png}
\caption{Third strategy: discipleship}
\label{pray-reach-disciple.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discipleship is at the heart of messianic community}
\label{discipleshipisattheheartofmessianiccommunity}

The forming of disciples is the very heart and centre of messianic community and mission. We are called and commissioned to make people from all nations into disciples, by immersing (baptising) them into the reality of God's life, through the Messiah, by the Spirit (Matthew 28:19--20).

\subsection{Discipleship deals with our hearts}
\label{discipleshipdealswithourhearts}

Discipleship deals with something deeper than the mind: our \emph{hearts}—the centre of our being, the seat of our motivation, our willpower, our commitment. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Authentic discipleship renews a person's heart, as new allegiances, loyalties and practical priorities are adopted and applied.

\item Through discipleship we are challenged to become wholly aligned with God's eternal and vocational purposes and to serve a new Master.

\end{itemize}

Unless our hearts are challenged and renewed in this way, we remain merely \emph{religious converts}—engaging in devotional, religious activity, whilst our will, character, allegiances, loyalties and lifestyle remain practically unchanged.

As we experience a process of formation into disciples of Jesus, we face the challenge of whether to make our whole heart available to God—or to shrink back from the demands of Messianic mission. Only as we allow our hearts to be transformed by the Holy Spirit do we begin the life of a disciplined co-worker of the Messiah\footnote{1 Corinthians 3:9}: one who has been authentically \emph{co-missioned} with him.

\subsection{The priority of discipleship}
\label{thepriorityofdiscipleship}

Because discipleship deals with the heart, it must be a strategic, practical priority that \emph{precedes} concentrated biblical teaching (\autoref{thestrategyofteaching}), which is for the spiritually mature. Teaching deals with our minds—our understanding, conviction and belief—and excessive teaching of immature, undisciplined people risks \emph{puffing them up with knowledge}, instead of \emph{building them up with God's love}.\footnote{1 Corinthians 8:1; Hebrews 12:7 (Proverbs 3:12)}

\begin{discuss}[\currentsectiontitle]

Use Discussion 3 now, or continue to \autoref{thestrategyofteaching} and use Discussions 1--6 together at the end of this Study

\end{discuss}

\section{The strategy of teaching}
\label{thestrategyofteaching}

The fourth strategy is teaching.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=262pt,height=29pt]{pray-reach-disciple-teach.png}
\caption{Fourth strategy: teaching}
\label{pray-reach-disciple-teach.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Solid food}
\label{solidfood}

\begin{quote}

Though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil—Hebrews 5:12--14
\end{quote}

The writer of Hebrews talks about \emph{solid food}, or \emph{strong meat\footnote{The translation, \emph{strong meat}, from the King James version captures well the sense of maturity required to ingest and digest challenging scriptural teaching.}}, as a metaphor for the challenging teaching of God's word. He chastises them that they should be teaching others by this time, yet instead they still need \emph{milk}—which is a metaphor for elementary teaching.

Strong meat is for those who have become committed disciples. For such people, biblical teaching represents a fruitful source of insight, conviction, trust, knowledge, wisdom and understanding. It develops and deepens knowledge and appreciation of messianic life, spirituality and vocational service.

\subsection{The whole counsel of God}
\label{thewholecounselofgod}

Paul writes to the Colossians about the need to receive \emph{The word of God in its fullness} or \emph{the whole counsel of God.}\footnote{Colossians 1:25; also Acts 20:27 ff.} One way of thinking about what that fullness might include is to consider three expressions of teaching that balance and complement each other.

\begin{itemize}
\item Pastoral-evangelistic

\item Prophetic

\item Apostolic.

\end{itemize}

Presenting the word of God in its fullness means holding together all three aspects.

\subsection{Pastoral-evangelistic teaching}
\label{pastoral-evangelisticteaching}

Pastoral-evangelistic teaching typically focusses upon the accumulated wisdom, knowledge, understanding and traditions of messianic community.\footnote{1 Timothy 3:15} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Calling disciples into \emph{The Way} of the Messiah

\item Studying and interpreting scripture (theology)

\item Exploring church history and denominational identity.

\end{itemize}

Historically, pastoral teaching and theology has tended to be protective of denominational tradition. In the modern period, it has also tended to be shackled to modern academic standards. Together these realties can contribute to spiritual sterility, generational inertia and a lack of effective engagement with those outside of messianic community. However, they can also contribute to the development of strong traditions and active, close-knit communities.

\subsection{Prophetic teaching}
\label{propheticteaching}

Prophetic teaching is directed towards interpreting the historical, contextual \emph{signs of the times\footnote{Matthew 16:3; see also 1 Chronicles 12:32}} that call for an appropriate response from messianic communities, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Weighing and critiquing the culture\footnote{We may think of culture as including the \emph{activities, institutions, knowledge, traditions, values, motivations and thought-processes} of a particular nation or people group.} of messianic communities and their response to God's historical, contextual, missional purposes, amongst the nations.

\item Offering and relating \emph{the word of life\footnote{Philippians 2:16}} to those outside of messianic community, including appropriately weighing and critiquing human culture, in the light of God's words.

\end{itemize}

Prophetic teaching has historically tended to represent a threat to mainstream Christian traditions, leading to a marginalisation of new movements and a deepening of mainstream inertia.

\subsection{Spiritual revelation}
\label{spiritualrevelation}

The spirit of \emph{revelation} plays a vital role in messianic teaching. The disciples experienced this when they met the risen Messiah.

\begin{quote}

He opened their minds, so that they could understand the Scriptures{\ldots}—Luke 24:45--47
\end{quote}

Revelation is a gift of the Spirit that opens our understanding to spiritual truths and realities. The Spirit of God expands our human understanding to incorporate spiritual truths that are not obtained by, or received within, our natural, rational minds. Instead, they are revealed to our our spirit.\footnote{1 Corinthians 2:6--16}

This is why Jesus challenged his disciples to recognise that our relation life is vital to understanding his teaching: many do not understand God's ways because they have no experience of, or desire to do, God's will (John 7:17)

\end{discuss}

\section{The strategy of sending}
\label{thestrategyofsending}

The fifth strategy is sending disciples.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=292pt,height=26pt]{pray-reach-disciple-teach-send.png}
\caption{Fifth strategy: sending}
\label{pray-reach-disciple-teach-send.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Culmination of strategies}
\label{culminationofstrategies}

\emph{Sending} represents a culmination of the four strategies that have preceded it: prayer, reconciliation with God, formation of disciples and teaching about the kingdom. It refers to being sent to fulfil a missional, vocational calling. This sending refers to two types of context.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Inter}-cultural

\item \emph{Intra}-cultural

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inter-cultural contexts}
\label{inter-culturalcontexts}

Inter-cultural mission implies being sent to significantly different cultural, ethnic and geographical contexts. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Intercultural work requires specialist intercultural training, experience and understanding, because culture profoundly affects how messianic community and vocation is translated into practice.

\item Intercultural work is typically highly-demanding, because of various risks and hardships related to living in and engaging with a different culture.

\item Intercultural work is the vocation of \emph{apostolic missionary teams} (\autoref{apostolicmissionaryteams}).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intra-cultural contexts}
\label{intra-culturalcontexts}

Because God sends the whole messianic community towards all the peoples and cultures of the world, mission is not limited to crossing geographic, ethnic or intercultural barriers. \emph{Intra-cultural mission} identifies that the messianic community is called and \emph{sent} towards the people within its own original context.

\begin{itemize}
\item Intra-cultural sending implies co-operating with God's purposes and forming disciples \emph{wherever} we are working: living out our vocational responsibility in ways that influence and transform homes, families, communities, workplaces and institutions.

\item Whatever vocational role we occupy, each disciple should recognise how faithfulness to the Messiah's missional priorities creates opportunities to introduce messianic perspectives, biblical truths and spiritual power into our personal and vocational contexts.

\item This includes participation in health-, wealth- and other worth-creating activities, such as arts, sports, media, civil service and government, which have historically been overlooked or devalued by some forms of Christian spirituality.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sent by the Spirit}
\label{sentbythespirit}

Whether inter- or intra-culturally, God is the one who equips, empowers and sends workers, by his Spirit. When a particular community \emph{sends} workers into any context, it needs to do so \emph{in step with the Spirit}, upholding God's sending of those people.\footnote{See Acts 13:1--4, for an example of the Messianic Community and the Holy Spirit acting in harmony together, in sending Paul and Barnabas on a missionary journey.}

\osection{Summary}

This concludes Study 2, \emph{The Strategies of Messianic Community}, which explored five foundational, missional strategies:

\begin{itemize}
\item Foundational prayer

\item Reconciliation with God

\item Formation of disciples

\item Teaching mature disciples

\item Sending missional disciples

\end{itemize}

As each generation of disciples follow these strategies, a cyclical process begins to establish an expanding, missional movement.

\section{Pastoral, evangelistic community}
\label{pastoralevangelisticcommunity}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=125pt,height=125pt]{pastoral-evangelistic-community.png}
\caption{}
\label{pastoral-evangelistic-community.png}
\end{figure}

Pastoral-evangelistic community is called to embody two particular characteristics.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pastoral, shepherding \emph{and}

\item Evangelistic, proclaiming.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pastoral, shepherding character}
\label{pastoralshepherdingcharacter}

In its pastoral, shepherding nature a community reflects the affirming, selfless, humble, protective, overseeing care of the \emph{Good Shepherd}, Jesus. In practice, this is demonstrated through being a community that is: 

\begin{itemize}
\item hospitable,

\item celebratory.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{A hospitable community}
\label{ahospitablecommunity}

Through hospitality, a community provides friendliness, kindness, warmth, welcoming, care, openness, acceptance and concern for the \emph{alien and stranger}—the outsider.

A hospital is a place of healing and restoration, suggesting that practical \emph{hospitality}, based upon opening our hearts and homes to one another, represents a vital aspect of generating \emph{healing} and \emph{health}.

\subsubsection{A celebratory community}
\label{acelebratorycommunity}

Through scripturally-motivated celebration, messianic communities can demonstrate both their own faithfulness towards God \emph{and} the goodness, kindness and provision of God towards his creation.

\begin{itemize}
\item The covenantal feasts, prescribed in the \emph{Torah}\footnote{The first five books of the Bible, accredited to Moses and forming the covenantal foundation of the nation of Israel.}, incorporate prophetic signs, pointing towards both the good things that God has done for his people \emph{and} his call to faithful service. The annual \emph{Passover} is the most significant Hebraic celebration. 

\item The new covenant, inaugurated by Jesus, provides a profound fulfilment of the Passover. The symbolic sharing of bread and wine, representing the body and blood of the Messiah, speaks of the Passover \emph{Lamb of God}, who sacrificed his life to serve God's eternal purpose. 

\item Celebrating the Messiah's sacrifice, through sharing our \emph{daily bread} with one another, reminds us of the devoted, sacrificial service to which we are called and commissioned, as members of the messianic community.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evangelistic, proclaiming nature}
\label{evangelisticproclaimingnature}

Through its evangelistic, proclaiming nature messianic communities reflect their confidence that the Messiah, Jesus, is Lord: over both the community itself and over the spiritual and natural powers that influence and shape human society. 

In practice, this is demonstrated through being a community that is:

\begin{itemize}
\item inviting,

\item believing.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{An inviting community}
\label{aninvitingcommunity}

An inviting community principally reflects its evangelistic perspective by inviting those outside the community to join in giving allegiance—worship, service and faithfulness—to the Messiah. 

However, \emph{being} inviting implies more than simply offering invitations to events, such as church meetings. It means expressing love for our neighbour, in a manner that almost irresistibly invites interest and involvement from outsiders.\footnote{Colossians 4:6; Philippians 2:4}

\subsubsection{A believing community}
\label{abelievingcommunity}

Messianic communities are bound together by a shared trust in and faithfulness towards the Messiah: expressing confidence in what God has done through him and corporately responding faithfully to his call.

Faith is most powerfully demonstrated through love. Sharing each others concerns and burdens is a vital aspect of trusting in and proclaiming our faithfulness to the Messiah. Love-in-action is a living demonstration of the Messiah's victory over our self-centredness.

\subsection{One community, two roles}
\label{onecommunitytworoles}

Clearly, the pastoral, shepherding nature and the evangelistic, proclaiming nature of messianic communities overlap each other. The most important thing is that faith expresses itself in love, as people become faithful disciples of the Messiah.

When a community is living a devoted, obedient, celebratory lifestyle that is hospitable, open and welcoming towards outsiders, its existence represents both \emph{embodiment} and \emph{proclamation} of the Good News.\footnote{1 Peter 2:12}

\subsection{Pastors and evangelists}
\label{pastorsandevangelists}

Those commissioned as pastors and evangelists are responsible for equipping the whole messianic community to express its pastoral and evangelistic nature. This is a leadership task—not a management role!

Thus, pastors are not called to the continuous and comprehensive upholding of each and every every family and community member—an impossible task! Nor are evangelists solely responsible for reaching people outside the community.

Pastors and evangelists are called to be inspirers, facilitators, catalysts and equippers, so that a \emph{whole community}—of all ages and abilities—is equipped to mutually support one another with hospitality and pastoral care \emph{and} to share their faith confidently with others, outside of the messianic community.

\subsection{Summary: Pastoral, evangelistic communities}
\label{summary:pastoralevangelisticcommunities}

Pastoral, evangelistic communities are called to be more than people who congregate for religious rituals. They are called to be a fellowship of people learning to share their lives and values in ways that practically express both the \emph{Shepherding} and the \emph{Lordship} of Jesus, so that the whole community is working together towards a shared, primary goal:

\section{Teaching and training centres}
\label{teachingandtrainingcentres}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=125pt,height=125pt]{teachingtrainingcentres.png}
\caption{}
\label{teachingtrainingcentres.png}
\end{figure}

Teaching and training centres supplement the formation of disciples taking place within pastoral, evangelistic community (\autoref{pastoralevangelisticcommunity}). Their function is to equip mature messianic disciples for vocational service, in two types of context: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item intra-cultural,

\item inter-cultural.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Intra cultural contexts}
\label{intraculturalcontexts}

Intra-cultural teaching and training equips messianic disciples and communities to live faithfully within their own culture, amongst their own people. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Researching, understanding, presenting and explaining the content of God's Word, in order to equip disciples with a \emph{messianic worldview}—a way of understanding and relating to the world with a biblical, messianic perspective.

\item Edifying—encouraging, strengthening and correcting—the practices and self-understanding of messianic communities, enabling them to become \emph{pillars and foundations of truth},\footnote{1 Timothy 3:15} in the context of cultures shaped by different spiritual and moral values.

\item Typical examples: Bible schools, conferences, seminars, workshops.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intercultural contexts}
\label{interculturalcontexts}

Inter-cultural teaching and training equips disciples to live faithfully amongst people of a different culture. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Preparing and equipping disciples with spiritual confidence and practical resources to undertake \emph{apostolic missionary work} in non-native contexts.

\item Researching, presenting, explaining, understanding the \emph{worldviews} of people from other cultures and religions.

\item Typical examples: Scripture translation, language learning, cross-cultural training, missionary trips. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Teachers and trainers}
\label{teachersandtrainers}

Messianic teachers and trainers are called to prepare mature disciples with an understanding of biblical truth that appropriately equips them for faithful works of service, in a variety of vocational contexts.\footnote{Ephesians 4:11--16} 

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Training} tends to emphasise learning from the experience of others, encouraging learners to be responsive and accountable to overseers, in specific contexts.

\item \emph{Teaching} tends to emphasise the value of knowledge and understanding, making learners responsible for evaluating, internalising and using knowledge, in multiple contexts. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary: Equipping with truth}
\label{summary:equippingwithtruth}

The characteristic role of messianic teaching and training centres is to supplement the formation of disciples taking place within pastoral, evangelistic communities, by:

\section{Apostolic missionary teams}
\label{apostolicmissionaryteams}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=125pt,height=125pt]{apostolicmissionaryteams.png}
\caption{Apostolic Missionary Teams}
\label{apostolicmissionaryteams.png}
\end{figure}

The function of apostles and apostolic, missionary teams (\autoref{amt}) is highlighted by two significant metaphors: \emph{ambassador} and \emph{master-builder}.

\subsection{Ambassador}
\label{ambassador}

International ambassadors are accredited diplomats, or emissaries, sent by a country as its official representatives to a foreign country. Paul uses this concept to describe the apostolic missionary role.

\begin{itemize}
\item Apostolic missionaries are sent by God, to represent him and his message, amongst people of other nations or cultures. Paul refers to this responsibility as being \emph{ambassadors of the Messiah}.\footnote{2 Corinthians 5:20--21}

\item Living and working inter-culturally, in non-native contexts, places significant additional demands upon workers, because of differences encountered in a whole range of experiences, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item language, climate and food;

\item political, economic and bureaucratic systems;

\item customs, social expectations and religious sensibilities.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Master-builder}
\label{master-builder}

Paul also compares the apostolic missionary role to that of a \emph{skilful architect and master builder, laying a Messianic foundation}.\footnote{I Corinthians 3:10--15} Architects and master-builders are responsible for both designing buildings and supervising the completion of the construction, following which they hand over responsibility for the building to others.

\begin{itemize}
\item Apostolic missionary teams cross geographical and cultural boundaries in order to pioneer the formation and establishment of pastoral, evangelistic communities (\autoref{pastoralevangelisticcommunity}) and messianic teaching and training centres (\autoref{teachingandtrainingcentres})—particularly amongst people and places where there are no gospel communities. 

\item In these ways, apostolic missionaries lay a messianic foundation amongst ethnic people groups, or within a particular geographical region. Because they are laying a foundation upon which others will build, the quality of their work is crucial to the future of messianic community in those places.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{First in the church}
\label{firstinthechurch}

Through these \emph{pioneering} roles, of ambassador and architect, apostles \emph{lay a foundation} for the building of the whole messianic community and, in this way, are considered \emph{first} amongst the Messianic Community.\footnote{1 Corinthians 12:28} 

Yet Paul, as one who experienced many trials and tribulations in his apostolic work,\footnote{Read 2 Corinthians 4:7--12 \& 6:3--10} identifies his apostolic, missionary service with being \emph{put on display at the end of the procession}.\footnote{1 Corinthians 4:9--13} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Paul is referring to the apostolic missionaries' need to face and to persevere in the presence of all kinds of difficult challenges—including embracing humiliation where necessary, for the furtherance of the message of the Messiah.

\item Through such sacrificial dedication, endurance of suffering, embrace of humility and deep-seated reliance upon the power of the Holy Spirit, apostolic workers represent a profound example to the whole Messianic Community, of our \emph{shared calling} to faithful missional service.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary: Pioneering with power}
\label{summary:pioneeringwithpower}

The characteristic role of \emph{apostolic missionary teams} is to lay a messianic foundation, by: 

\begin{quote}

\textbf{Skilfully, resolutely, purposefully, sacrificially pioneering in the power of the Spirit: planting and establishing both pastoral, evangelistic communities and teaching and training centres, in new geographical and cultural contexts}.
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=125pt,height=0.75\textheight]{pioneeringpower.png}

\label{pwp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Option}
\label{option}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss [\emph{Pioneering with power}], or

\item Continue to \emph{Prophets, priests, mediators} (\autoref{prophetspriestsmediators})

\end{itemize}

\section{Prophets, priests, mediators}
\label{prophetspriestsmediators}

In his letter to the Ephesians,\footnote{Ephesians 4:11--12} Paul describes five special leadership gifts, given by the Messiah to prepare his body for works of services. The gifts of pastor, evangelist, teacher and apostle are clearly represented by one or other of the three principal structures that we have examined (\autoref{structures}), whereas the role of \emph{prophet} is not. This section examines how the prophetic ministry functions within the \emph{structural} perspective that we've been exploring.

\subsection{Heart of Messianic Community}
\label{heartofmessianiccommunity}

At the centre of the [trialogue][Introducing the trialogue] is a space where the three principal structures overlap. I believe this central space can be understood and identified as representing the \emph{prophetic heart} of messianic community—as illustrated in \autoref{pr}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=256pt,height=199pt]{propheticpriestlymediatoryrole.png}
\caption{Prophetic Role}
\label{propheticpriestlymediatoryrole.png}
\end{figure}

The idea of a central heart, interacting with and influencing each of the other ministry structures provides a profound metaphor for the prophetic ministry. It confirms that the prophetic role is vital, influential and central—even though it functions in a relatively hidden, non-structural manner.

Interestingly, Paul describes the foundational significance of the prophet as second only to that of the apostle.\footnote{1 Corinthians 12:27--31} My observation is that the prophetic role is easily misunderstood, reacted to, dismissed and under-appreciated, perhaps partly because of its somewhat hidden way of functioning. Yet, when embraced, it has a profound capacity to spearhead deep, spiritual renewal.

\subsection{Dual mediatory role}
\label{dualmediatoryrole}

The prophetic ministry fulfils a dual \emph{mediatory} role of both priestly and prophetic mediation, on behalf of the messianic community.

\subsubsection{Priestly mediation}
\label{priestlymediation}

Priestly mediation involves \emph{speaking with God, on behalf of human beings}, based upon a purity of heart and faithfulness of life that is able to offer effective intercession on behalf of others.\footnote{James 5:13--20; Psalm 24:3--4; also \emph{Module 8: The Dynamic of Intercession}.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Faithfully modelling, advocating and encouraging the vital mediatory work of \emph{intercessory prayer}, sharing the intercession of the Holy Spirit.\footnote{Romans 8:26--27}

\item Facilitating, with others, a fulfilment of the Messianic Community's calling to be \emph{a house of prayer for all nations}.\footnote{Matthew 21:13, c.f. Isaiah 56:7}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Prophetic mediation}
\label{propheticmediation}

Prophetic mediation involves \emph{speaking with human beings, on behalf of God}, based upon a particular capacity and responsibility for \emph{hearing what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic Community.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Providing discernment, direction and insight—when messianic communities are embracing the challenges and responsibilities of particular contexts and historical events.

\item Providing exhortation, clarification and even rebuke—when messianic communities are failing in their vocational calling to serve God's purposes. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{God's heartbeat}
\label{godsheartbeat}

The prophetic role may also be referred to as \emph{hearing God's heartbeat}.\footnote{See \emph{Module 8: The Dynamic of Intercession}.} This idea communicates the spiritual intimacy that enables prophets to:

\begin{itemize}
\item walk sufficiently closely with God to discern the thoughts, feelings and intentions upon his heart;

\item share in the intercessory ministry of the Spirit;

\item discern and share God's \emph{kairos\footnote{\emph{Kairos} is a Greek word, referring to a particularly opportune, favourable, suitable or appropriate moment---e.g. see John 7:6--8, 12:23; Luke 21:13; Mark 13:4; Acts 1:6--7; 1 Timothy 2:6; it contrasts with \emph{chronos}, referring to fixed, measurable units of time.}} word for a particular context.

\end{itemize}

\begin{description}

\item[Note]

\emph{Those gifted to walk prophetically with God are often sensitive personalities and may well be poets, artists, writers, visionaries or other kinds of imaginative, inventive or creative individuals}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Summary: Picking up God's heartbeat}
\label{summary:pickingupgodsheartbeat}

The prophetic role is easily overlooked or misunderstood, because of its relatively obscure, non-structural mode of functioning. It is essentially a mediatory role, requiring a sensitive, intimate, faithful walk with God that enables prophets to:

\begin{quote}

\textbf{Pick up God's heartbeat for the peoples of the world, interceding with the Spirit for the purposes of God and hearing and conveying what he is saying to the messianic community—especially during times of historical crisis and vocational opportunity} (\autoref{pgh}).
\end{quote}

\section{Interaction}
\label{interaction}

Having explored separately the foundational messianic structures, this final section explores some of the vital ways in which the structures function in interaction with each other.

\subsection{Foundational structures}
\label{foundationalstructures}

The three overlapping circles

As in \autoref{foundational-structures}, which represents a ``trialogue'' of the foundational structures of messianic community:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pastoral, evangelistic communities;

\item Teaching and training centres;

\item Apostolic, missionary teams.

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=262pt,height=174pt]{foundationalstructures.png}
\caption{}
\label{foundationalstructures.png}
\end{figure}

This diagram represents the three foundational structures of messianic community:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pastoral, evangelistic community;

\item Teaching and training centres;

\item Apostolic, missionary teams.

\end{itemize}

These structures are designed to work together, in combination, as part of regional or national missional movements, serving God's eternal purpose. In the following sections, each structure is explored separately, before considering some of the important outcomes that occur when these structures interact together, in obedience to the Spirit.

\subsection{Structures and strategies}
\label{structuresandstrategies}

\emph{The Strategies of Messianic Community} (\autoref{thestrategiesofmessianiccommunity}) illustrated and explored five foundational strategies—pray, reach, disciple, teach, send—that correspond closely with the foundational structures, explored in this study, as displayed in \autoref{table1}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\bottomrule

\end{tabulary}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}

\subsection{Structural interactions}
\label{structuralinteractions}

An effective missional, discipleship movement becomes established as divinely-ordained messianic structures learn to function faithfully and interact dynamically with one another, in accordance with God's strategic design and purpose—as Paul wrote to the Ephesians:

\begin{quote}

You are{\ldots}members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole \emph{structure} is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built spiritually into a dwelling place for God—\emph{Ephesians 2:19b--22}
\end{quote}

Some of the dynamic interactions suggested by such an integrated, holy movement are illustrated in \autoref{si} and tabulated in \autoref{table2}.

This study compares and contrasts three examples of organic and organisational \emph{reproduction} with the organised \emph{expansion of disciple-forming movements}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Honey bees (\autoref{honeybees})

\item Maize plant (\autoref{maizeplant})

\item Commercial organisations (\autoref{commercialorganisations})

\item Missional movements (\autoref{missionalmovements})

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Terms}
\label{terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Increase} : refers to numerical growth

\item \textbf{Expansion} : refers to geographical enlargement, or extension.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scripture}
\label{scripture-expansion}

Read these passages aloud together. \emph{Observe how each passage summarises a significant period of activity, during which early messianic communities established a missional movement of disciples.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Acts 2:42--47

\item Acts 6:7

\item Acts 9:31

\item Acts 12.24

\item Acts 16.5

\item Acts 19.20

\end{itemize}

Memorise the following passages, in time for your next meeting:

\begin{description}

\item[Acts 1:8]

But you shall receive power—ability, efficiency and might—when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to the ends—the very bounds—of the earth!

\item[Acts 9.31]

The Messianic community throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace and was built up. They lived in the fear of the Lord, with the counsel of the Holy Spirit; and their numbers kept multiplying.
\end{description}

\section{Honey bees}
\label{honeybees}

A bee colony is a kind of \emph{collective organism}, because individual bees cannot survive very long outside of a colony and, although there are clearly defined \emph{roles}, there is no hierarchy or leadership. A bee colony may contain between 2,000 and 60,000 bees, including: 

\begin{itemize}
\item a single fertile \emph{queen bee}

\item a few thousand fertile male \emph{drone bees}

\item several thousand non-fertile female \emph{worker bees}

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=150pt]{swarm.png}
\caption{A swarm of bees}
\label{swarm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Increase}
\label{increase}

A colony grows as workers raise thousands of new bees, born to the queen. Usually, around a queen's second springtime, a colony will prepare to \emph{swarm} (\autoref{swarm}). In readiness for swarming, worker bees begin preparing new virgin queen bees, one of which will take over the existing hive, by killing all of the other virgin queens, after the old queen leaves with the swarm.

\subsection{Division}
\label{division}

When it is time for the swarm to leave the hive, \emph{scout bees} will find a suitable place for the swarm to gather initially and report this location to the colony. Shortly afterwards, about 6 out of every 10 worker bees in the colony—usually the the most vigorous ones—swarm around the queen bee. The swarm then leaves the hive altogether, moving directly to the scouted location.

\subsection{Expansion}
\label{expansion}

Scout bees must swiftly identify a suitable permanent hive location, so the swarm can form a new colony. This step is critical because swarming bees can survive on the honey in their stomachs for only 2--3 days. Once a new hive is settled, the cycle of growth begins again. The old queen may not live long and must quickly start the process of repopulating the colony, including producing new virgin queens, ready to take over her role. 

\subsection{Summary}
\label{summary}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{}
\label{ide}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Increase} leads to \textbf{division} leading to \textbf{expansion} 

Organic, steady, cyclical \emph{increase} in numbers of bees, produces swarming and a eventual \emph{division} of the colony, which then \emph{expands} into a different area.

\item \textbf{Harvest} 

Bees produce an abundance of honey, from plant pollen, which is used to feed the growing colony; honey is also a harvestable crop for both humans and wild animals, such as bears.

\item \textbf{Risks} 

Swarming \emph{divides} the colony, weakening both groups.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option}
\label{option}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss \emph{Bees} (\autoref{bees}), or

\item Continue to \emph{Maize plant} (\autoref{maizeplant})

\end{itemize}

\section{Maize plant}
\label{maizeplant}

The maize plant is a rapidly-reproducing cereal crop, with a leafy stalk, typically growing two or more metres high (\autoref{mp-fig}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=150pt]{mp-diagram.png}
\caption{Maize plant}
\label{mp-fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Increase}
\label{increase}

Maize plants grow from seeds sown into the ground. Growth begins when the seed's hard, outer shell breaks open, allowing the soft, inner kernel to access the moisture and nutrients within the soil. It immediately sprouts roots and a single stem that moves upwards, towards the surface of the soil. 

Once through the surface, the plants leaves can begin photosynthesising sunlight, while its roots continue drawing on soil nutrients and moisture. In arid locations, typical of Africa, the most significant growth factor is a sufficiency of rainfall.

\subsection{Multiplication}
\label{multiplication}

Each maize plant produces a number of ears, each of which typically contains 600--800 seeds. Thus, in one season, a single plant may produce thousands of seeds.

\subsection{Expansion}
\label{expansion}

Maize plants expand into new areas through redistribution of their seeds. Because of the way the plant has been cultivated, over hundreds of years, the intervention of farmers is required to effectively distribute seeds. 

\subsection{Summary}
\label{summary}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=200pt,height=0.75\textheight]{multiplication.png}
\caption{}
\label{ime}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Increase} leads to \textbf{multiplication} leading to \textbf{expansion} 

Organic \emph{increase}, as each plant grows, potentially producing a thousand-fold \emph{multiplication} of seeds, often twice a year, allowing rapid \emph{expansion} of crop, depending upon climate and soil conditions.

\item \textbf{Harvest} 

Maize is a valuable crop, suitable for use in a variety of foodstuffs.

\item \textbf{Risks} 

Shallow roots make plants susceptible to poor soils, drought and severe winds.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option}
\label{option}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss \emph{Maize} (\autoref{maize}), or

\item Continue to \emph{Commercial organisations} (\autoref{commercialorganisations})

\end{itemize}

\section{Commercial organisations}
\label{commercialorganisations}

Commercial, business organisations (including most charitable enterprises) seek to achieve \emph{economic growth}, using profit and loss accounts as the primary indicator of success and failure. A large corporation, such as a mineral company, can often grow to employ hundreds of thousands of people, in multiple offices, in many different countries, with a budget larger than some nations.

\subsection{Increase}
\label{increase}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=250pt,height=0.75\textheight]{organisation.png}
\caption{Organisational growth}
\label{og}
\end{figure}

Organisational growth is marked by an increase in commercial measurements such as turnover, profit, employees, management experience, production capacity, market size and share and so on. At some point, most organisations reach a limit to their growth in one or other of these areas. Further growth is (usually) sought by duplicating the number of outlets (shops, offices, factories etc.) owned or managed by the organisation.

\subsection{Duplication}
\label{duplication}

Duplication essentially reproduces, in a new location, a \emph{copy} of an existing, successful model. This builds upon proven characteristics of the original concept, increases production and establishes an identifiable brand. Buildings, budgets, payrolls and competition typically play a significant role in decision-making processes, usually controlled closely by a centralised, hierarchical, \emph{command-and-control} structure of management. 

\subsection{Expansion}
\label{expansion}

Regional location, form, speed and costs of expansion are usually determined by a central, organisational strategy. If a new structure does not function according to expectations, it may be closed down—without reference to local, contextual concerns.

\subsection{Summary}
\label{summary}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=200pt,height=0.75\textheight]{duplication.png}
\caption{}
\label{idue}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Increase} leads to \textbf{duplication} leading to \textbf{expansion}

Unpredictable, inorganic growth measured by \emph{expansion} of profits, personnel and management experience, leading to \emph{duplication} of structures (premises and management hierarchy) and geographical \emph{expansion} of the market being served.

\item \textbf{Harvest} 

Successful duplication leads to increased profits and more managers. 

\item \textbf{Risks} — duplication typically ignores or suppresses local insight and initiative and the effect of contextual differences on the establishment of new structures.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option}
\label{option}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss \emph{Organisations} (\autoref{organisations}), or

\item Continue to \emph{Missional movements} (\autoref{missionalmovements})

\end{itemize}

\section{Missional movements}
\label{missionalmovements}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{A people movement} : represents an informally-organised grouping of people and organisations, dedicated to achieving shared political, social, or artistic ideas, ideals and goals. 

\item \textbf{A missional movement} : represents an informally-organised grouping of people and organisations, dedicated to serving God's eternal purpose.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Increase}
\label{increase}

Missional movements grow through the forming of disciples who make disciples, who make disciples (see \emph{The Commissioning of Messianic Community} (\autoref{thecommissioningofmessianiccommunity}) and \emph{The Structures of Messianic Community} (\autoref{thestructuresofmessianiccommunity}). Disciples do more than simply \emph{believe} in missional values: they \emph{embody} core beliefs and values by realigning their lives, in order to affect their own contexts and futures — including making disciples{\ldots}who make disciples{\ldots}who make disciples and so on.

\subsection{Reproduction}
\label{reproduction}

Within missional movements, as in nature, not all reproduction succeeds. Some individuals and groups fail to mature. Others reach maturity, but don't reproduce. Some start slowly, others rapidly. Some groups evolve a different sense of identity, purpose or form to that of their originating contexts. 

\subsection{Expansion}
\label{expansion}

\begin{quote}

The wind blows (breathes) where it wills; and though you hear its sound, yet you neither know where it comes from, nor where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit—\emph{John 3:8}
\end{quote}

Ultimately, the Holy Spirit is responsible for governing the wild, haphazard growth of a missional, discipling movement capable of impacting communities, regions and even nations, over time.

\begin{itemize}
\item It is the Holy Spirit who is able to direct how and where to establish our efforts and energies.\footnote{Witness the role of the Holy Spirit, throughout \emph{Acts} (see Scripture readings, \autoref{scripture-expansion})}

\item It is the Holy Spirit who takes hold of a community, implanting a missional vision larger than that of any individual or single organisation.

\end{itemize}

Throughout the world, within every people group, wherever willing hearts and available hands are found, the Holy Spirit is working to establish a community that manifests God's heart. \emph{The dynamics and disciplines that we are studying in this syllabus illustrate and demonstrate how he works amongst us, moving us onwards towards this goal.}

\subsection{Summary}
\label{summary}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=200pt,height=0.75\textheight]{reproduction.png}
\caption{}
\label{ire}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Increase} leads to \textbf{reproduction} leading to \textbf{expansion}

An \emph{increase} in fruitfulness amongst missional movements is measured in terms of disciples, in whom their is a faithful \emph{reproduction} of the life of the Spirit, including the vision to produce disciples amongst people of all nations, leading to a cultural \emph{expansion} of the sphere of the Gospel's influence.

\item \textbf{Harvest} 

Members exhibits wide variety of charisma, talent and contextual influence. As the Good News is accepted amongst people, it leads to gradual transformation amongst families, households, communities, societies, cultures and people groups. 

\item \textbf{Risks} 

Missional movements are unpredictable; results are difficult to measure and assess accurately; groups that lose focus and faithfulness to foundational values, slow the pace of change and expansion—yet are difficult to identify and reform.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option}
\label{option}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss \emph{Movements} (\autoref{movements}), or

\item Continue to \emph{Summary} (\autoref{summary-expansion}) and \emph{Discussions} (\autoref{expansion})

\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-expansion}

This concludes the study, \emph{The expansion of Messianic Community} (\autoref{theexpansionofmessianiccommunity}), which explored three examples of either organic or organisational reproduction, in order to compare and contrast them with the organised expansion of messianic, discipleship movements. 

The study highlighted characteristics associated with the growth, reproduction, relocation, harvest and risks of swarming bees, maize plants, commercial organisations and missional movements. In summary, the study explored how:
