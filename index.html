<p><a href="http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com">Maize Plant Discipleship</a> is a modular learning resource, consisting of approximately 60 scripturally-based studies. Designed to be practical, relevant and accessible for use in African contexts. Derived and road-tested in collaboration with African leaders and learners. Formulated in response to contextual doctoral research conducted in Burkina Faso, West Africa.</p>

<ul>
<li>A syllabus of modular studies, for use in small learning groups.</li>
<li>Incorporating reflective learning and group discussions.</li>
<li>Suitable for informal and formal modes of study.</li>
<li>Linguistically and economically accessible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of Maize Plant Discipleship is to facilitate learning that moves continuously outwards, drawing whole communities into patterns of scripturally-based discipleship, in living dialogue with contextual culture.</p>
